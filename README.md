# Census Salary Classification Prediction
Project about creating a prediction model using classification model to predict whether an salary above 50.000 or not. Based on workers information dataset. And achieved a 71% F1-Score

#### -- Project Status:  Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether an individual earns more than 50,000 per year based on various demographic and financial attributes. This problem is a binary classification task where the target variable is 'salary', indicating whether an individual's income exceeds 50,000. To address this problem, we will implement and evaluate several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By using the F1 score, we aim to achieve a model that not only identifies positive instances accurately but also minimizes the occurrence of false negatives and false positives.
